# EXPERIMENT 2 - NUMERICAL PYTHON (NUMPY)
## I. Intended Learning Outcomes:
1. To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Numpy library
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Numpy library

## II. Instructions:
#### Write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter
notebook in the dedicated submission bin.

## 1.) NORMALIZATION PROBLEM:
#### Normalization is one of the most basic preprocessing techniques in data analytics which involves centering and scaling process. Centering means subtracting the data from the mean and scaling means dividing with its standard deviation. #### Mathematically, normalization can be expressed as: ùëç = ùëã ‚àí ùë•ÃÖ / ùúé. In Python, element-wise mean and element-wise standard deviation can be obtained by using .mean() and .std() calls.
#### In this problem, create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X.
#### Save your normalized ndarray as X_normalized.npy


## Start 
#### Import the numpy library
```python
import numpy as np
```
#### Initialize variable X as a randomized 5x5 array
```python
X = np.random.rand(5,5)
# Initialize and set X_mean as the mean of X
```python
X_mean = X.mean()
```
# Initialize and set X_std as the standard deviation of X
```python
X_std = X.std()
```
# Perform calculation by setting Z as the Normalized form of X
```python
Z = (X - X_mean) / X_std
```python
```
# Save the normalized array to a .npy file
```python
```
np.save('X_normalized.npy', Z)
# Test if loading the npy file works
```python
np.load('X_normalized.npy')
```
## End

```
## 2.) DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM: 
#### Create a 10 x 10 ndarray which are the squares of the first 100 positive integers.
#### From this ndarray, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3. Save the result as div_by_3.npy

```python
# Start
# Import the python library numpy
import numpy as np
# Generate a 10x10 ndarray with squares of the first 100 positive integers
A = np.arange(1,101).reshape(10,10)**2
# Find all elements in the generated array that are divisible by three
divisible_by_3 = A[A % 3 == 0]
# Save the result to a .npy file
np.save('div_by_3.npy', divisible_by_3)
# Test by loading the saved npy file
np.load('div_by_3.npy')
# End

```
